<h2>Cat6 Ethernet Cables</h2>
<p> These cables are used to connect all computers in the media lab to the main network. They allow upto 100mbps / 100Mhz data transfer rate. These are very useful when connecting to a network as hardwire is alot faster and more reliable than wireless. </p>

<h2>27" iMac - Retina Display </h2>
<p> There are approximately 50 27" iMacs in the Wigan 401 media lab. These are available for the students to use. Each computer is connected to the network, and each student has there own account to log into on that network. As well as this students can also log into a local guest account. The computers themselves also each have a 1TB local scratch drive, if wanting to use them offline of the network.   </p>

<h2>Projectors and Presentation Computer</h2>
<p> At the front of the media lab there are 3 HD projectors, as well as a Mac Pro connected to them. These projectors are used to showcase student work and for lectures to present. Like all othere computers, the presentation computer is able to connect to the Pheonix drive and others. The Mac pro is isolated from the presentation display and is connected with many data cables such as, HDMI and thunderbolt, Power Source, Mouse and Keyboard and USB hub cables. </p>

<h2>UFB Network</h2>
<p> Like the rest of the university, Wigan 401 has gigabit UFB broadband installed. This allows for smooth, uninterrupted internet service to students and staff. As well as this, the hardware for UFB allows much faster communications locally, allowing servers and networks to run more smoothly. There are various hardware components needed for UFB which are present in Wigan 401, such as an ETP (outside the building), an UFB router and fibre optic cabling. </p>
